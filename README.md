Hello, I'm Collin Bolles, a research software engineer for SAIL at Boston University. My work entails mostly full stack web development for various research projects through Boston Univerity. While I'm mostly working on web development, my background also includes cloud computing and embedded development.

### Projects I'm Currently Working on

### SAIL

#### SignLab

At SAIL I am currently working on a project called SignLab. SignLab is a tool designed to give researchers the ability to tag short videos. The intention is to produce a flexible enough tool that many researchers will be able to utilize the interface. The immediate goal is to support ASL based research involving tagging short videos containing signs based on the goals of the research study.

### Smart AC

A side project of mine has been the "smartification" on my AC units. The goal is to have the AC units adjust automatically based on internal and external temperature and to be controllable remotely. The project has included reverse engineering the IR protocol used to control the units and replicating the signals using an ESP32. Additionally, a RGB matrix has been used to display information to me at my desk.

## Previous Projects

#### Firmware Team Lead for the Electric Vehicle Team
EVT at RIT is a team dedicated to building and racing electric vehicles. As the firmware lead, I managed the software that is developed for the team.

A large part of my role was the development of "EVT-core" an embedded library to enable the firmware team to develop for the ST micrcontrollers used on the various boards required for the motorcycle system. EVT-core has allowed for the use of various I/O interfaces include CAN, i2c, SPI, UART as well as the various built in hardware features of the STM.

For more information on EVT-core, you can view the repository [here](https://github.com/RIT-EVT/EVT-core) or view the Read the Docs site [here](https://evt-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Battery Management System (BMS) Firmware for the Electric Vehicle Team

One of the critical systems on the DEV-1 (Dirt Electric Vehicle) project is the Battery Management System (BMS) which handles the health and safety of the custom battery pack. One of my roles on the team included the development of the firmware that runs on the BMS. Firmware developement for this project revolved around safety and reliability. If you are more interested in how the firmware operates, I encourage you to view the [Read the Docs page](https://dev1-bms.readthedocs.io/).
