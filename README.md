Hello, I'm Collin Bolles, a senior Computer Science student at RIT. I'm the current Firmware Lead on EVT at RIT and a Software Engineer at Lib Src Inc while I finish my degree. I'm currently looking for a full time role starting this Summer 2022. If you have more interest in my technical background, I invite you to view [my resume](https://github.com/cbolles/cbolles/blob/master/resume/collin_bolles.pdf).

### Projects I'm Currently Working on
#### Firmware Team Lead for the Electric Vehicle Team
EVT at RIT is a team dedicated to building and racing electric vehicles. As the firmware lead, I manage the software that is developed for the team. Mainly what we do is write custom firmware which runs on the custom designed
electronics on our motorcycles.

A large part of my role has been the development of "EVT-core" an embedded library to enable the firmware team to develop for the ST micrcontrollers used on the various boards required for the motorcycle system. EVT-core has allowed for the use of various I/O interfaces include CAN, i2c, SPI, UART as well as the various built in hardware features of the STM.

For more information on EVT-core, you can view the repository [here](https://github.com/RIT-EVT/EVT-core) or view the Read the Docs site [here](https://evt-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Battery Management System (BMS) Firmware for the Electric Vehicle Team

One of the critical systems on the DEV-1 (Dirt Electric Vehicle) project is the Battery Management System (BMS) which handles the health and safety of the custom battery pack. One of my roles has been the development of the firmware that runs on the BMS. Firmware developement for this project has revolved around safety and reliability. If you are more interested in how the firmware operates, I encourage you to view the [Read the Docs page](https://dev1-bms.readthedocs.io/).
