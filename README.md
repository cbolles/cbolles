Hi! I'm Collin Bolles a Computer Science student at RIT minoring in Computer Engineering. 
I am in my final year in the undergrad program at RIT while also working
part time at D3 engineering. For more information on my technical background,
I encourage you to check out 
[my resume](https://github.com/cbolles/cbolles/blob/master/resume/collin_bolles.pdf).

### Projects I'm Currently Working on
#### Firmware Team Lead for the Electric Vehicle Team
EVT at RIT is a team dedicated to building and racing electric vehicles.
As the firmware lead, I manage the software that is developed for the team.
Mainly what we do is write custom firmware which runs on the custom designed
electronics on our motorcycles.

Currently we are working on our own software stack to run on the STM
microcontollers. You can view the project named "EVT-core" at
[this location](https://github.com/RIT-EVT/EVT-core) and can also
check out our work in progress Read the Docs site [here](https://evt-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
