Hi! I'm Collin Bolles a Computer Science student at RIT minoring in Computer Engineering. 
I am currently between internships having finished one from August 2020 - December 2020 at
Herrick Technology Labs in Maryland. Next I will be back in Rochester at D3 Engineering.

### Projects I'm Currently Working on
#### Firmware Team Lead for the Electric Vehicle Team
My role is to develop firmware for the electric motorcycles that our team is currently running.
We develop with STM32F302R8s and SM32F446REs directly with the HAL to write our custom firmware.
Currently we are working to finish our transition away from MBED to use mainly the HAL for
interacting with the micro-controllers.

#### BLT (Boundary Limited Text extraction tool)
The goal of the BLT is to allow users to provide images of their video game collection and for
the system to automatically catalog all the games. This will be done by first detecting each
individual box and running text extraction on the generated subimages. I have been working on
identifying the individual video game boxes and prepping the images to run the text extraction.
